Peiriant PÃ¢r - Pair Machine

A DIY eurorack platform based around an ATMega1284

Currently configured as a two channel piano-roll sequencer with glide, variable sequence length and diatonic transposition.
See the issues - there's currently some problems with my liberal use of interrupts.

Initially developed to be as simple as an arduino, an SSD1306 screen, two MCP4822 dacs, two push-button rotary encoders and two pots.
I'm hoping to share this reduced version in the future.

Feel free to reach out to me on reddit (u/WelchRedneck) or instagram (@WelchRedneck) if you have any questions. 
If you end up making one I'd love to see, also!

I'm using the MightyCore hardware platform to upload arduino sketches to the MCU, and an arduino uno as the ISP programmer- see https://github.com/MCUdude/MightyCore
